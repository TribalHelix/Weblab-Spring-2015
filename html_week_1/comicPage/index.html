            I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS. TERRAX SAID <STRONG>GALACTUS</STRONG> WAS WEAK. BUT HE'S HOLDING HIS OWN
            AGAINST THOR AND IRONMAN TOGETHER!
        </span>
         <span id="bubble3">
            I AIN'T SO SURE OF THAT TORCHIE. IS IT MY IMAGINATION...
        </span>
        <span id="bubble4">
            ...OR DOES GALACTUS LOOK...SMALLER?
       </span>
       <span id="bubble5">
           IT'S NOT IMAGINATION, BEN. GALACTUS IS USING HIS ENERGY
           RESERVES FASTER THAN HIS BODY CAN REPLENISH THEM. HE'S
           ACTUALLY DWINDLING IN SIZE
       </span>
      <span id="bubble6">
          BUT I FEAR HIS POWER MAY STILL PROVE TOO MUCH. HE MAY
          YET EMERGE THE VICTOR IN THIS
